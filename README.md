Data Science Project 2 - EDA

**Part 1: Extract and Transform Data**

Purpose: Extract the data from source (the excel files). Transform the data to generate 4 target tables that adhere to the designed database. Save that data as CSV files.

**Output:**

A Jupyter Notebook for extracting and transforming data.
ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb
4 CSV files representing the transformed data ready for the database:

1.category.csv

2.subcategory.csv

3.campaign.csv

4.contacts.csv


**Part 2: Design and Create the Database**

Purpose:Design and create the Database inside of PostgreSQL.

**Output:**

ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) as a PNG image.
PDF documentation of the ERD and schema design.
Physical ERD code for QuickDBD as a TXT file.
Database schema in Crowdfunding_db_schema.sql.

**Part 3: Load the data into Postgres.**

Purpose: Load the transformed CSV data into the PostgreSQL database using python library pandas.

**Output:**

A Jupyter Notebook that reads each CSV and writes the data to the PostgreSQL database.

**Part 4: Analysis and Visualization**

Purpose: Analyze the loaded data with SQL queries, followed by visualizing the results using Matplotlib.

**Output:**

A crowdfunding_queries.sql file with few queries.
A notebook that contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Matplotlib.
Analysis_crowdfunding.ipynb

Images of all charts and graphs used for data visualizations.

**Part 5: Summarize the Project**

**Output:**

A PDF write-up that summarizes the project.
